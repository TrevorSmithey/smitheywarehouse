## Product-Level Insights

### First Purchase → Repeat Rate

**Set buyers are collection builders:**

| First Purchase | First Buyers | Repeat Rate |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Set of 4 No. 6 Skillets | 775 | **37.5%** |
| $25 Gift Card | 3,700 | 32.4% |
| Carbon Steel Set | 646 | 27.4% |
| The Perfect Pair | 1,248 | 26.1% |
| The Essentials Set | 1,014 | 25.8% |
| No. 12 Combo Set | 4,672 | 25.3% |
| Founder's 3-Piece Set | 4,034 | 25.1% |

**Gift/accessory-only buyers don't return:**

| First Purchase | First Buyers | Repeat Rate |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Ornament | 6,748 | 18.7% |
| Mighty Spatula | 7,944 | 19.3% |
| Care Kit | 6,568 | 20.8% |
| Chainmail Scrubber | 32,990 | 21.4% |

**Lowest repeat rate (likely gifts):**

| First Purchase | First Buyers | Repeat Rate |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| No. 6 Dual Handle | 1,037 | **14.9%** |

The No. 6 Dual Handle has the lowest repeat rate — likely purchased as gifts (small skillet, lower price point).

**The insight**: Set buyers repeat at **37%** vs accessory-only buyers at **19-21%**. Nearly 2x. Sets attract collection builders; standalone accessories attract gifters.

### Cross-Sell Patterns

Top second purchases after a **No. 12 Skillet**:

| Second Purchase | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| Chainmail Scrubber | 1,539 |
| Seasoning Oil | 1,421 |
| Leather Skillet Sleeve | 1,110 |
| 12" Glass Lid | 1,055 |
| Spatula | 930 |
| Engraving | 812 |

The No. 12 is the gateway product. Customers who buy it return for the accessory ecosystem.

### Category Repeat Rates

| Category | First Buyers | Repeat Rate |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Dutch Ovens | 9,754 | 22.5% |
| Carbon Steel | 23,080 | 22.4% |
| Skillets | 67,099 | 22.1% |
| Accessories | 32,990 | 21.4% |

Categories perform similarly (~22%) when purchased as first item. The variance comes from *which specific product* within the category.

## Re-engagement Timing

Based on the cumulative return curve, optimal campaign timing:

| Trigger | Days Since Last Order | Audience | Rationale |
|---------|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| **First nudge** | 90 days | New (1 order) | 53% have returned; 47% need a push |
| **Second push** | 180 days | Still unconverted | 36% of eventual returners are still out there |
| **Final attempt** | 365 days | Sleeping | 80% have returned; last 20% worth one more try |
| **VIP win-back only** | 545+ days | Lapsed VIPs | General population not worth the spend |

After 545 days, focus win-back exclusively on the 5,201 Lapsed VIPs ($1,000+ lifetime spend).

---

## Data Notes

- **LTV = Net Product Revenue**: `subtotal_price - total_discounts` (excludes tax, shipping)
- **Refunds excluded**: Orders with `financial_status = 'refunded'` removed (356 customers)
- **Customer matching**: By Shopify customer_id (email-based). Same person, different emails = different customers
- **Gift purchases**: Not flagged. Gift recipients don't appear; repeat rate may be slightly overstated

---

## Why These Thresholds

Generic e-commerce uses 90/180 day cutoffs for consumables/fashion.

Cast iron cookware is different:
- Median second purchase at 72 days (collection builders)
- Long tail extending to 18+ months
- 36% of returners come back after the typical 180-day "churn" cutoff

Setting churn at 180 days would misclassify over a third of future repeat buyers as lost.
